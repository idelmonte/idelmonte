## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a rising junior at Mount Holyoke College with intrests across several disciplines. I love working on projects that allow me to apply my math and data science knowledge to problems in other fields such as public health, economics, physics, and social justice.

Throughout my time as an AI Fellow with Break Through Tech, I have developed a strong foundation in machine learning concepts and gained valuable experience collaborating on ML projects with a team of peers. I'm also currently working as a research assistant in the Mount Holyoke College Department of Mathematics & Statistics. Alongside my fellow research assistants, I have developed a compartmental differential equation model for TB spread in the US, which I have optimized using a custom genetic algorithm for parameter fitting. 

I love learning new skills and information by working on projects. Please reach out if you ever want to collaborate!
