## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a rising junior at Mount Holyoke college with several intrests across disciplines; I love working on projects that allow me to apply my math and data science knowledge to problems in physics, public health, economics, and social justice.

As a Break Through Tech AI Fellow at Cornell Tech, I have developed a mathematical and computational foundation in machine learning. I'm also currently a research assistant working with Professor Dylan Shepardson in the Mount Holyoke College Department of Mathematics and Statistics. Alongside Professor Shepardson and my fellow research assistants, I have developed a compartmental differential equation model for TB spread in the US, which I have optimized using a custom genetic algorithm for parameter fitting. 

I love clean code, messy datasets, and telling powerful stories with data. Let’s connect!
