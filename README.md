## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a rising junior at Mount Holyoke college with intrests across several disciplines; I love working on projects that allow me to apply my math and data science knowledge to problems in other fields such as physics, public health, economics, and social justice.

As a Break Through Tech AI Fellow, I have developed a strong foundation in machine learning concepts and gained valuable experience solving ML problems with a group of my peers. I'm also currently working as a research assistant in the Mount Holyoke College Department of Mathematics & Statistics. Alongside my fellow research assistants, I have developed a compartmental differential equation model for TB spread in the US, which I have optimized using a custom genetic algorithm for parameter fitting. 

I love learning new skills and information by working on projects. Please reach out if you ever want to collaborate!
